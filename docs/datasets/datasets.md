## Datasets

### Naming Convention

We set a standard naming convention for all datasets. This is to ensure that all datasets are organized in a consistent manner.

**General Rules**

- Directories in `kebab-case`.
- Files in `kebab-case`.

**JSON**

- Keys in `camelCase`.

**CSV**

- Headers in `CAPITAL LETTERS`.
